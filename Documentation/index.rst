**About this manual**

((This container is a beast, it has lots of knowledge built in, offers lots
of features. I you'd only know what and how. This manual is there to help.

t3docs/render-documentation is the TYPO3 Docker container, for local and server
used, requires (only) Docker, has lots of built in knowledge. The manual
((soll Zugang geben)) to the various aspects of the container. To answer
questions: How does it work? capabilities, simple and advanced usage))

.. _operating-systems:

**Operating systems**

For Linux, Mac and Windows.

At its core Docker is a Linux solution. `Docker Machine
<https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/>`__ has come to make it run on Mac
and Windows as well. The container will run just the same on Linux, Mac and
Windows.

However, most of this manual is written from the perspective of a Linux user
when it comes to "How to use the container."

If you are on Windows and can help to port the solutions to Windows - you are
welcome. Very much!
